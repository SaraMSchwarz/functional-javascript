# Notes on Functional JavaScript

## What is functional programming?
- breaking up your code to verbs, think in terms of actions
- use a lot of functions, passing functions to functions, etc.
- goal is to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style
- what to solve vs. how to solve
- building functions for immutable variables
- getting rid of side effects
- a function with clearly declared in and outputs is one without side effects
- a function without side effects is a pure function
